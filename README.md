###Summary###
Music Fly is an application that aims to bring music streaming from different platforms into one cohesive player. The application uses the Spotify and SoundCloud API for users to search for desired songs that can be stored in playlists created by the user. All songs can also be played using a responsive audio player than can play, pause and skip songs in any given track list. In the near future I am planning on adding features for users to create an account and save playlists for future log ins. All client side features were built with Angular.js and the server side was built using Node.js with Express.
**_All songs belong to either Spotify or Soundcloud and any of their affiliates_**
